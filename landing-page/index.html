              <p>Galaxies consist of stars, dust, and gas bound together by gravity, and we see them from afar as stars.
                 People have appreciated galaxies with an other-wordly fascination since we first looked up at the night
                  sky. Our place in the galaxy continues to fascinate today, as our compilation of galaxy quotes goes to show. </p>
